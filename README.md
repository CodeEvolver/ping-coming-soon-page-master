## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [JavaScript](https://javascript.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I used this code to do a simple validation of inputed email address

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
    const x = document.getElementById('email-input').value;
    const at = document.getElementById('email-input').value.indexOf("@");
    if(x === "") {
        document.getElementById('email-input').style.borderColor = "hsl(354, 100%, 66%)";
        document.getElementById('error-message').style.color = "hsl(354, 100%, 66%)";
        document.getElementById('error-message').innerHTML = "<i>Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email</i>";
    }else if(at === -1) {
        document.getElementById('error-message').style.color = "hsl(354, 100%, 66%)";
        document.getElementById('error-message').innerHTML = "<i>Please provide a valid email address</i>";
    }
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I'll will like to focus on concepts related to technologies(JavaScript) more than design...like form validation and the likes

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46155/how-can-i-validate-an-email-address-in-javascript) - This helps in validating email with JavaScript. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
